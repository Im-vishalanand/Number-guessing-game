# Number-guessing-game

This is a small game made by me during learning the C program.
<br>

In this game,<br>
  When you will start to play the game, it will ask you to enter the numbers between 1 and 100.<br>
  After guessing the number it will tell you to guess higher number or lower number is the guessed number is incorrect.<br>
  When you will guess the correct number after n number of attempts, it will show you the number of times you have taken to guess the correct number.<br>
