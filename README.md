# Number-guessing-game

This is a small game made by me during learning the C program.

In this game,
  When you will start to play the game, it will ask you to enter the numbers between 1 and 100.
  After guessing the number it will tell you to guess higher number or lower number is the guessed number is incorrect.
  When you will guess the correct number after n number of attempts, it will show you the number of times you have taken to guess the correct number.
